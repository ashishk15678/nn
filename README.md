## Introduction

Neural networks are a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain, that are designed to recognize patterns. They interpret sensory data through a kind of machine perception, labeling, and clustering of raw input. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive guide to neural networks, from basic concepts to advanced implementations.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you will need to have a basic understanding of machine learning and neural networks. If you are new to these concepts, we recommend starting with the following resources:

- [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course)
- [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies for this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nn-repo.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd nn-repo
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

This section provides an overview of how to use the code in this repository. Below is an example of how to train a simple neural network using the provided scripts.

1. Prepare your dataset:

   ```python
   from data_preparation import prepare_data
   train_data, test_data = prepare_data('path/to/dataset')
   ```

2. Define your neural network model:

   ```python
   from models import NeuralNetwork
   model = NeuralNetwork(input_size=784, hidden_size=128, output_size=10)
   ```

3. Train the model:

   ```python
   from training import train_model
   train_model(model, train_data, epochs=10, learning_rate=0.001)
   ```

4. Evaluate the model:
   ```python
   from evaluation import evaluate_model
   accuracy = evaluate_model(model, test_data)
   print(f'Test Accuracy: {accuracy}%')
   ```

## Examples

Here are some examples of neural network implementations included in this repository:

### Example 1: Handwritten Digit Recognition

This example demonstrates how to build and train a neural network to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

### Example 2: Image Classification

This example shows how to use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

### Example 3: Text Classification

This example illustrates how to use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to classify text data.
